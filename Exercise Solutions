Q1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the order of the pixel structure?
Answer:- 
CvMat has a format (int rows, int columns, int type) and can consist of any of the following
  - 32 bit floating points'
  - 3 8 bit unsigned integer triplets
  - any other format
  
A program reads the object data in the same format starting from rows to columns to type. 
The pixel structure order is bit_depth, channel type and number of channels
