Q1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the order of the pixel structure?
Answer:- 
CvMat has a format (int rows, int columns, int type) and the type can consist of any of the following
  - 32 bit floating points'
  - 3 8 bit unsigned integer triplets
  - any other format like (bit depth,channel type, number of channels)
  
A program reads the object data in the same format starting from rows to columns to type. 
The pixel structure order is bit_depth, channel type and number of channels.

Q2.1 Run the code in ColorImage.cpp and comment on the outputs.
Answer:- It shows convesion from original image in RGB to different colorspaces namely YCrCb & HSV.



Q2.2 Print out the values of the pixel at (20,25) in the RGB, YCbCr and HSV versions of the image. 
What are the ranges of pixel values in each channel of each of the above mentioned colorspaces?

r: 224; g: 132; b: 122; 
y: 159; cb: 176; cr: 105
h: 9;s: 123; v: 229

Range :- 
RGB - 0-255
YCbCr - 0-255
HSV- 0-360

Q3. Median filter seems to work the best.
